# pandas-challenge
This is my Module 4 challenge submission

For this challenge, I referenced the bootcamp activity files to check for the syntax to use.
When I would encounter an error, I consulted with Xpert Learning Assistant or ChatGPT to find out what was wrong. 

Challenge portions where I consulted with Xpert Learning Assistant or ChatGPT:
- code to select all of the school types
- match scores by grade
- reading scores by grade
